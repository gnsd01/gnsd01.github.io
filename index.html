<h2 style="font-family: 'Gulim'; font-size:15px; letter-spacing: 3px">Robots</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Gulim'; font-size:13px; letter-spacing: 3px">Our understanding of robotics is bound to expand more and more in our near future and robot may very well become a greater part of our daily lives. Already today, there are so many robots that we use every single day. In general, robots will come with benefits as well as detriments. When used as bionic arms and other body parts, they become a great invention that could really help a mass of people that would have otherwise had many more hardships in life, especially with domestic tasks that the common person could do without much thought. In the case of a self-driving car, the number of accidents and deaths related to automobile collisions would drastically decrease because accidents would be caused by operation errors rather than human errors, such as being tired, drunk, or simply having slower reflexes and longer processing time than a machine. At the same time, there are people that actually enjoy driving, or the hundreds of thousands with jobs are drivers that are in risk of losing their job to robots. In cases like this, I think it is important to make sure that options are open. People should not be forced to rely on self-driving cars, but perhaps the option to use this as a feature can be open. Most importantly, however, the people creating these bots and deciding what becomes a norm in society should be diverse with different backgrounds, different problems, and different ideas to make sure that all people can be included.



<h2 style="font-family: 'Gulim';font-size:15px; letter-spacing: 3px">Women in Tech: Robotics</h2>

<p style="font-family: 'Gulim'; font-size:13px; letter-spacing: 3px">Today we were introduced to Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard. We were able to understand the importance of developing our skill in robotics, such as in creating a way for robots to adapt and adjust to unknown circumstances like how Veloso's robot dogs were able to go after a ball no matter where the ball ended up and to get back up after falling on the ground. This technology can be used for a greater scheme, perhaps in helping elderly people easily stand up with the help of a robot or for a Mars Rover to be able to go to a certain destination by avoiding obstacles and detecting a logical route. It is also important to create technology that can help integrate those with disabilities and differences with the technology that is commonly used today but lack this inclusion in its original design, similar to Howard's invention that uses a sensor to navigate through apps and devices using touch and swipes. This could help thousands of people that are unable to access devices or need tools that will read what is on a screen. In our own experiments with Arduino, we faced many difficulties and complications, such as certain pins not working, or simply figuring out the path and order for an LED to light up. Despite the hardships, we eventually were able to figure out each problem and come up with solutions as a team. Similar to what we've done with python and even scratch, we first began by discussing our idea, then pseudocoding, designing the breadboard, and finally, running code through Arduino. There were the most difficulties with the breadboard and creating paths for each LED. Coding was relatively smooth as we worked together and made connections with our prior experiences with python and scratch. If we had more time, we would've also included a piezo to add sound and correspond with each light.  </p>
